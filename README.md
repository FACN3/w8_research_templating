## What problems do templating languages solve?
You should use a JavaScript templating engine like Handlebars.js when:

* You use a JavaScript front-end framework like Backone.js, Ember.js, and the like; most front-end JavaScript frameworks rely on templating engines
* The application’s view (the HTML page or portions of the page) will be updated frequently, especially as a result of changes to the data either from the server via a REST API or from data on the client  
* You have multiple tech stacks that depend on your data from the server and you want all the tech stacks to process the same data  
* Your application has much interactivity and it is very responsive  
* You are developing a single-page web application with multiple views  
* You want to easily manage your HTML content; you don’t want your JavaScript code to contain important HTML markup.
